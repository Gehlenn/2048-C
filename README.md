# 2048-C
Hi!

The 2048 game in simple C, made by me, first-semester student of Computer Engineering at UTFPR - Pato Branco.

Our final semester work was to replicate the famous game 2048 in C, and now I share my work with you. I didn't make an interface, as we haven't learned that yet, but some messages are shown in the terminal to guide the user.

Hope you like it.
